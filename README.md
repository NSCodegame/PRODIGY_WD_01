## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Navbar Scroll Effect**  
   - The navbar background changes when the user scrolls down more than 50px (`.scrolled` class).

2. **Hamburger Menu**  
   - On smaller screens, the navigation menu toggles via a hamburger button.

3. **Contact Form**  
   - The form displays a success message when submitted (simulated using JavaScript in `script.js`).
